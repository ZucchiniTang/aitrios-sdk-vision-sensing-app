# Develop AI model on Vision and Sensing Application SDK

Vision and Sensing Application SDK provides following functions to prepare AI model:

## 1. Transfer learning
This part describes how to train an AI model. <br>

See [README](./1_train_model/README.md) for details.

## 2. Model quantization

This part describes how to quantize an AI model and convert it into a format that can be imported to Console for AITRIOS. <br>
Supported AI models are based on [Model Compression Toolkit (MCT)'s features](https://github.com/sony/model_optimization/tree/v1.7.1#supported-features).<br>
See [README](./2_quantize_model/README.md) for details.

## 3. Import model to Console for AITRIOS

This part describes how to import model to Console for AITRIOS. <br>

See [README](./3_import_to_console/README.md) for details.

## 4. Deploy model to Edge AI Device

This part describes how to deploy model to Edge AI Device. 

See [README](./4_deploy_to_device/README.md) for details.

## More functions
### Delete AI model from Console for AITRIOS
See [README](./delete_model_on_console/README.md) to get started.
